Internet-Draft: Proposal for the "llm" URI Scheme

1. Introduction
This document proposes a new Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
scheme, "llm", intended for identifying and interacting with Large
Language Models (LLMs) over the Internet. The "llm" scheme aims to
standardize the way in which applications and users access and query
LLMs, facilitating interoperability, security, and efficiency.

1.1. Background
Large Language Models have become ubiquitous in providing sophisticated
text generation, language understanding, and other AI-driven services.
However, the absence of a standardized method for accessing these
models leads to fragmentation and complexity in their integration
and use. The "llm" URI scheme addresses this gap by providing a
uniform way to reference and interact with LLMs.

2. Specification Template

2.1. Scheme Name
The scheme name for the URI is "llm".

2.2. Status
Permanent.

2.3. Applications/Protocols that Use This URI Scheme Name

The "llm" URI scheme is used by web browsers, API clients, and other
software applications that require direct interaction with Large
Language Models for generating text, processing natural language,
or other AI-driven tasks.

2.4. Encoding Considerations

URI characters in "llm" URIs are encoded according to the rules set
forth in RFC 3986.

2.5. Intended Usage

The "llm" URI scheme is intended for use in applications where
direct, standardized access to LLMs is necessary. This includes
software development, academic research, and any application requiring
dynamic text generation or language analysis.

3. Syntax

The "llm" URI scheme follows the generic URI syntax as specified
in RFC 3986. The scheme-specific syntax is as follows:

llm://provider/model?parameters

provider is the domain name or identifier of the LLM provider.

model specifies the particular model to be queried.

parameters is a query string containing the parameters of the
request, such as prompt, temperature, and max tokens.

4. Semantics

provider: Identifies the LLM service provider, facilitating access
to multiple providers under a unified scheme.

model: Allows specific LLMs to be targeted, accommodating the diverse
range of models available.

parameters: Supports flexible querying by including request-specific
parameters.

5. Security Considerations

The "llm" URI scheme allows for provider-specific authentication
information such as access tokens. Care should be taken to ensure
that this kind of sensitive information is not exposed , especially
when shared or stored.

It is recommended to avoid this possibility by using environment
variables or other secure methods to store and access authentication
information as specified by the specific LLM providers.

6. Interoperability Considerations

To ensure ease of interoperability, an MIT-licensed reference
implementation is available at https://github.com/marhar/llmuri.
