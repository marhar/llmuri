Internet-Draft:

    Proposal for the "llm" (Large Language Model) URI Scheme

URI schema names:

    llm
    llms


Introduction:

    This document proposes a new Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    scheme, "llm", intended for identifying and interacting with
    Large Language Models (LLMs) over the Internet and on local
    hosts.  The "llm" scheme aims to standardize the way in which
    applications and users access and query LLMs, facilitating
    interoperability, security, and efficiency.

    A related "llms" scheme is identical but specifies a secure
    connection.

Background:

    Large Language Models have become ubiquitous in providing text
    and image generation, language understanding, and other AI-driven
    services.  However, the absence of a standardized method for
    specifying and accessing these models leads to fragmentation
    and complexity in their integration and use. The "llm" URI
    scheme addresses this gap by providing a uniform way to reference
    and interact with LLMs.

Status:

    permanent

URI scheme syntax:

    The "llm" URI scheme follows the generic URI syntax as specified
    in RFC 3986. The scheme-specific syntax is as follows:

        llm-specification:
            llm:provider[@host[:port]]/model-name[?parameter-list]

        parameter-list:
            parm1=value1[&parm2=value2]...

URI scheme semantics:

    - Both "llm:" and "llms:" are supported schema types.
      "llms:" indicates that the LLM service is hosted on a secure
      connection (e.g.  "https:").  If the schema is not specified
      but obvious from application context, "llm:" is assumed.

    - provider is the name of the LLM API or service.

    - host is an optional hostname where the LLM service is
      located.

    - port is the service's port number.

    - model-name is the name of the model to be executed.

    - parameter-list is a list of model-specific parameters.

Examples:

    llm:example-provider/mymodel
    llm:example-provider?temperature=0.2&max_tokens=100
    llm:example-provider@example.com:11434/mymodel
     
Encoding considerations.
    
    URI characters in "llm" URIs are encoded according to the rules
    set forth in RFC 3986.

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:

    Applications, APIs, and other systems that require interactions
    with LLMs and related services.

Interoperability considerations.

    To ensure ease of interoperability, an MIT-licensed reference
    implementation is provided at the site referenced below.

Security considerations.

    It is possible that some providers may allow access credentials
    or other sensitive information to be included in the URI.  Care
    should be taken to ensure this information is not exposed.
    When possible, other means of authentication should be used.
